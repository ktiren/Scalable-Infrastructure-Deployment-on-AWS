## Introduction

Deploying scalable infrastructure on AWS can be complex. This project simplifies the process by providing Terraform scripts and a CloudFormation template to set up a robust and scalable infrastructure. The infrastructure includes components like EC2 instances, Load Balancers, Auto Scaling Groups, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- An AWS account with sufficient permissions to create and manage resources
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- Terraform installed
- Basic knowledge of AWS services and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) concepts

## Getting Started
**1. Clone the repository:** 
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scalable-infrastructure-aws.git
cd scalable-infrastructure-aws
```
**2. Navigate to the desired deployment method:**

- For Terraform: cd terraform
- For CloudFormation: cd cloudformation

## Deployment with Terraform
**1. Initialize Terraform:**

```
terraform init
```
**2. Review and customize variables:**

Edit the main.tf file to set your desired values for the variables.

**3. Plan the deployment:**

```
terraform plan
```
**4. Apply the deployment:**

```
terraform apply
```
**5. Confirm the action when prompted.**

**6. Verify the deployment:**

Once the deployment is complete, you can verify the created resources in the AWS Management Console.

## Deployment with CloudFormation
**1. Navigate to the CloudFormation directory:**

```
cd cloudformation
```
**2. Deploy the CloudFormation stack:**

```
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name scalable-infrastructure --template-body file://template.yaml --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```

## Monitor the deployment:

You can monitor the stack creation progress in the AWS Management Console under the CloudFormation section.

## Verify the deployment:

Once the stack is created, you can verify the created resources in the AWS Management Console.

## Cleaning Up
To avoid incurring unnecessary charges, ensure you delete the resources once you are done testing.

## Terraform

```
terraform destroy
```

## CloudFormation

```
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name scalable-infrastructure
```
